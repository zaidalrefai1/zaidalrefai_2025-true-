My Journey

Hello, I am Zaid Alrefai. I am a sophmore at Del Norte Highschool and am taking APCSP. Throughout the course of the past week I have learned commands to use in my terminal. I have learned to set up an environment and how to start projects as well as how to create directories and repositories. I have learned how to create a webpage and how to add submenus to it as well.
